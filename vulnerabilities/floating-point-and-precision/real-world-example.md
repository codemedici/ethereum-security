## Real-World Example: Ethstick

The [Ethstick](http://bit.ly/2Qb7PSB) contract does not use extended precision; however, it deals with wei. So, this contract will have issues of rounding, but only at the wei level of precision. It has some more serious flaws, but these relate back to the difficulty in getting entropy on the blockchain \(see [Entropy Illusion](../entropy-illusion/)\). For a further discussion of the Ethstick contract, we’ll refer you to another post by Peter Vessenes, “[Ethereum Contracts Are Going to Be Candy for Hackers](http://bit.ly/2SwDnE0)”.
