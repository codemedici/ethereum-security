Real-World Examples: OpenAddressLottery and CryptoRoulette Honey Pots  
A honey pot named [OpenAddressLottery](http://bit.ly/2AAVnWD) was deployed that used this uninitialized storage variable quirk to collect ether from some would-be hackers. The contract is rather involved, so we will leave the analysis to the [Reddit thread](http://bit.ly/2OgxPtG) where the attack is quite clearly explained.

Another honey pot, [CryptoRoulette](http://bit.ly/2OfNGJ2), also utilized this trick to try and collect some ether. If you can’t figure out how the attack works, see “[An Analysis of a Couple Ethereum Honeypot Contracts](http://bit.ly/2OVkSL4)” for an overview of this contract and others.
