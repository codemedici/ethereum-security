# Preventative Techniques

The Solidity compiler shows a warning for unintialized storage variables; developers should pay careful attention to these warnings when building smart contracts. The current version of Mist \(0.10\) doesnâ€™t allow these contracts to be compiled. It is often good practice to explicitly use the memory or storage specifiers when dealing with complex types, to ensure they behave as expected.
