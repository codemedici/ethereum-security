# Default Visibilities

## Function Visibility

Since pragma `0.5.0`, function visibility must be explicitly marked. In previous versions the visibility modifier in Solidity defaults to public for functions and internal for variables. Public access to functions intended for internal use only can be disastrous, so keep an eye on that when dealing with older compilers.  
Also note that gas cost varies with visibility. In some cases, public functions will spend considerably more gas than an external function would, so always favor external visibility, when possible.  
There are four visibility specifiers, which are described in detail in the [Solidity docs](http://bit.ly/2ABiv7j).  
Example:

contract HashForEther {

    function withdrawWinnings\(\) {  
        // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0  
        require\(uint32\(msg.sender\) == 0\);  
        \_sendWinnings\(\);  
     }

     function \_sendWinnings\(\) {  
         msg.sender.transfer\(this.balance\);  
     }  
}

Unfortunately, the visibility of the functions has not been specified. In particular, the `_sendWinnings` function is public \(the default\), and thus any address can call this function to steal the bounty.
