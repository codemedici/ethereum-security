# Uncle-bandit

**Uncle blocks** are created when two blocks are mined and broadcasted at the same time \(with the same block number\). Since only one of the blocks can enter the primary Ethereum chain, the block that gets validated across more nodes becomes the canonical block, and the other one becomes what is known as an uncle block. Uncle blocks are recorded and accessible from the chain, but they have no impact on the canonical chain and their transactions do not change any state. Unlike Bitcoin, in the Ethereum system, miners still receive a block reward for discovering the uncle block.
