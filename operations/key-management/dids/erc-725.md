# ERC-725

## Introduction

We will use the term “proxy identity” or “identity” in short to refer to a smart contract acting on behalf of its owner\(s\), such as humans, groups, objects, and machines and controlled by keys. I.e. anyone or anything can use a cryptographic key pair to deploy and control a proxy identity contract on the Ethereum blockchain.

A proxy identity is much better than just a key pair because all of the functionality needed to manage keys throughout their lifecycle is already programmed inside the smart contract, using the standard interface described in [ERC725](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/725).

Managing keys using smart contracts enables them to become objects with properties which can be manipulated by their owners just like computer programs. Proxy identities will mainly do the following actions on behalf of their owner\(s\):

* **Store** – information \(claims signed by other users/identities\) about the identity itself, and a list of other keys allowed to manage the identity or execute actions on its behalf.
* **Execute** – calls to other smart contracts or send ether/tokens. Can only be executed by owner or authorized keys.
* **Sign** – claims about other identities or keys.
* **Verify** – claims made by other identities to other identities. For example, a KYC proof can be signed by an authorized KYC provider \(the issuer\), about a subject \(prover\) who then presents that proof to a smart contract or person \(verifier\) in order to prove their identity.
* **Encrypt** – data to hold in claims.

Both authentication and authorization between users of this system are enforced by the smart contract’s logic, instead of through a centralized database. This decentralization allows all users \(both humans and machines\) to reliably verify information about each other, in other words this allows mutual authentication between any two users \(identities\), without relying on any centralized infrastructure.

This concept is called “decentralized identity”3 or “self-sovereign identity”, because all users are in possession of the key\(s\) they use to identify themselves, sign claims about other users’ identities, and execute operations through smart contracts. This puts users in control of their identity, allowing individuals to maintain full control over their privacy, as well as decide how and what data is shared. It enables people to monetize their personal information themselves.

As already mentioned, identities can represent both individuals and entities such as businesses. These entities can be represented as an ERC725 smart contract with multiple owners. Keys can be assigned a specific clearance level or purpose; the following example shows an identity contract configuration where any added key can be assigned up to four different purposes based on their access level:

```text
// 1: MANAGEMENT keys, which can manage the identity
uint256 public constant MANAGEMENT_KEY = 1;

// 2: EXECUTION keys, which perform actions in this identities name (signing, logins, transactions, etc.)
uint256 public constant EXECUTION_KEY = 2;

// 3: CLAIM signer keys, used to sign claims on other identities which need to be revokable.
uint256 public constant CLAIM_SIGNER_KEY = 3;

// 4: ENCRYPTION keys, used to encrypt data e.g. hold in claims.
uint256 public constant ENCRYPTION_KEY = 4;
```

In the above example, the management key has clearance level 1, meaning it can also do any of the actions with clearance levels above one. This is just an example, anyone can arbitrarily code access control logic into their smart contract identities by assigning a different purpose to each key.

## What is ERC 725?

ERC 725 is a proposed standard for blockchain-based identity authored by Fabian Vogelsteller, creator of ERC 20 and Web3.js. ERC 725 describes proxy smart contracts that can be controlled by multiple keys and other smart contracts. ERC 735 is an associated standard to add and remove claims to an ERC 725 identity smart contract. These identity smart contracts can describe humans, groups, objects, and machines. ERC 725 lives on the Ethereum blockchain.

“ERC-725” refers to a specific smart contract design that acts as the individual’s core identity manager on the blockchain . The fundamental logic of the [ERC-725](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/725) gives the individual the ability to associate themselves with signing and encryption keys, but the ERC-725 also includes logic for executing and approving Ethereum transactions and is designed flexibly to be used in combination with a claims contract \(e.g. [ERC-735](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/735), [ERC-780](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/780)\) to expand the types of identity data recorded on the blockchain.

## Why ERC 725?

ERC 725 allows for self-sovereign identity. Users should be able to own and manage their identity instead of ceding ownership of identity to centralized organizations. We have seen the negative effects of having centralized identity with damaging leaks and unfair selling of user data and identity. An open, portable standard for identities will enable decentralized reputation, governance, and more. Users will be able to take their identity across different Dapps and platforms that support this standard.
